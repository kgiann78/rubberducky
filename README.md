# Rubber Ducky for Terminal

This is a classic rubber ducky application based on a couple other great rubberducky apps.

The current effort combines the simplicity of [kaicataldo's rubberducky](https://github.com/kaicataldo/rubberducky) and the more advanced [Rubber Ducky Slack Chatbot](https://github.com/s-wigg/Rubber-Ducky-Chatbot).

This app is using [bisoncorps' search-engine-parser](https://github.com/bisoncorps/search-engine-parser) in order to allow ducky to make google searches.
